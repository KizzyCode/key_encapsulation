# KyNc
This crate is a Rust interface to [KyNc](https://github.com/KizzyCode/kync/blob/master/Kync.asciidoc) plugins.


## What is the purpose of KyNc and this crate?
Short: Abstracting key management away.

Long: [KyNc defines](https://github.com/KizzyCode/kync/blob/master/Kync.asciidoc) and this crate implements a plugin
interface, that allows to use plugins for key management. Your app generates a random key to do something and the user
can specify how this key is stored. Some users may install a plugin that uses GnuPG to seal the key, some people may
load a plugin that uses a password to encrypt the key, and some companies may use their own custom plugins that
integrate perfectly in their environment. And they only need to do it once ‚Äì because if a specific plugin has been
created, it can be used with all applications that implement KyNc.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è State ‚ö†Ô∏è
This library and standard are alpha and neither audited nor frozen. Use at your own risk and feel free to contribute.


## Known plugins that implement KyNc
. Currently none ‚Äì but I'm working on a GnuPG plugin to utilize my Yubikey üôÉ
